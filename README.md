# Multiswitch Python script

A script for setting up a Multifunctional Switching Device using downlinks sent from The Things Stack LoRaWAN IoT network.

This is a script that is the basis of the [Multiswitch Python program](https://github.com/OndrejKnebl/Multiswitch_Python_program). Everything needs to be defined manually in this script.
